## Music App

Creating a React website that showcases your favourite artists songs/albums.
Not the biggest music person, so this gonna be tough

### to do list 

1. Setup your first React App using npm and vite. [Done!]
2. Install the required libraries [Done!]
3. Using JSX, make your website a portfolio of their work.
4. The site should be broken down into components that are rendered on the same page.

    1. It should contain at the very minimum two components. An example would be:

        1. Their name, music type and an introduction paragraph. [Done!]
        2. A list of their songs/albums including name,release date and cover art. damn son [Done! (most of them)]

    2. Add a 'Like' feature to your music page

        1. Add an element eg. a button, or an icon next to each song [Done!]
        2. When a user clicks the element, change something about it to indicate the user has 'liked' the song [Done!]
        3. When a user clicks again, the element should revert back to the 'unliked' view [Done!]
        4. Use state to track if a track has been liked or not [Done!]
        5. You may create additional components to acheive this as you see fit [Done!]

    3. Add a controlled form
        1. Create a controlled form into which users can provide data
        2. On submission, do something with this data

#### Refactor your music app to have a better file structure and props

1. Requirements are:

    1. Refactor your file structure if appropriate [Done!]
    2. Implement props [Done!]
    3. Pass data from a parent component to a child component [Done!]
    4. Pass a callback function from a parent component to a child component and invoke it on an event in the child component [Done!]

#### Extend your music app to include useEffect

1. Requirements are:

    1. Fetch some data from an API of your choice - (lyrics.ovh or Bandsintown are two options with no required authentication or key but feel free to use any!) [cannot find api]
    2. Set an interval for something to happen (it doesn't have to involve an API call - how about a background colour that changes every 30 seconds?) and make sure to clear it in a timely manner![Done!]
